# Music Bar
Music Bar provides a music-sharing platform that allows people to **share their favorite music and enjoy the shared playlist together**.
People who have joined in the same Music Bar room will share a single playlist so that they can interactively add their favorite music to the playlist.
The shared playlist can be played through a communal speaker within the room, whether it's a shared living space, office, or dormitory.
For music that most people don't like, a voting system is designed to let people vote and skip the music.

This is a full-stack web project.
For the front-end, we use **React** to construct the responsive user interface for Music Bar.
For the back-end, we use **Node.js** and **PostgreSQL** to launch the server and store user data.
Additionally, **Socket.IO** is used to update the real-time information in the system, such as the playback progress or the playlist.
We had also deployed the website to **AWS**(currently down).
